  # Explicit reload for the loaded-but-not-re-executed case. The extended
  # hook and this method share this single implementation, so re-running
  # workflow.rb (Workflow.require_workflow with update: true, which
  # re-fires Module#extended) and calling the function behave identically.
  #
  # Files are loaded with `load` (not require) so they re-execute on every
  # reload. They are expected to wrap themselves in their workflow module
  # (the convention of TaskDefinition.source and the helper generator), so
  # task, helper and entity DSL declarations register on the workflow.
  #
  # ScoutCoder: `base.module_eval { load file }` does NOT make the loaded
  # file see base as self; Kernel#load always evaluates the file at
  # top-level (self=main), which is why draft files must wrap themselves
  # in their workflow module. Verified empirically with probes before this
  # module was written; document this in Workflow docs if it is not there.
  #
  # Re-loading never raises on re-declaration: tasks reassign, helpers
  # redefine, and re-extending Entity is expected. Removed files leave
  # their tasks/modules in memory for the process lifetime (Ruby cannot
  # unload constants or methods); a fresh process clears them, so removal
  # is tolerated here and simply stops re-registering.
